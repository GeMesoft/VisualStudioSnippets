When you need to have a project with dll or standard libraries, the best way to have it all at GIT is using the subtrees.
There is other option, submodules, but is harder to understand.
==============================================================
1-Just create in your main project a folder which will contain the libraries.
-FileMaintenance = Main project.
-ExternalLibs = folder to contain the libraries or modules.
Example:
FileMaintenance\ExternalLibs

2-Open git bash console, better than the command prompt from windows. (git bash must be installed.)
GeMe@GeMe-Win2012DataCenter MINGW64 ~
$

3-Go to the main project folder at the bash: Note: If you are on windows, change the slash from the back to the front.
Example: <path>\FileMaintenance -><path>/FileMaintenance
cd <path>/FileMaintenance

If your main project folder is under git control vertion, the bash console will show the "(master)"
GeMe@GeMe-Win2012DataCenter MINGW64 /d/Desarrollo/TFS-Git/Personal/FileMaintenance (master)
$

4-Start adding all the dll that you want to be linked to the project and also it must be under git.
git remote add -f <alias> <url to git dll>
Example: git remote add -f GMS_LIB_DATA_ACCESS http://192.168.1.6:9090/tfs/Personales/_git/GMS_LIB_DATA_ACCESS

The alias is goint to be very usefull at the next commands.

5-Start downloading the master branch from the dlls.
git subtree add --prefix <folder>/<alias> <local branch> <remote branch>
Example: git subtree add --prefix ExternalLibs/GMS_LIB_DATA_ACCESS GMS_LIB_DATA_ACCESS master

6-When the extraction finish, you will have copy of the dll in the given folder.
